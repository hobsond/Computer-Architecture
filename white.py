# Given the following array of values, print out all the elements in reverse order, with each element on a new line.
# For example, given the list
# [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
# Your output should be
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.

# Given a hashmap where the keys are integers, print out all of the values of the hashmap in reverse order, ordered by the keys.
# For example, given the following hashmap:
# {
#   14: "vs code",
#   3: "window",
#   9: "alloc",
#   26: "views",
#   4: "bottle",
#   15: "inbox",
#   79: "widescreen",
#   16: "coffee",
#   19: "tissue",
# }
# The expected output is:
# widescreen
# views
# tissue
# coffee
# inbox
# vs code
# alloc
# bottle
# window
# since "widescreen" has the largest integer key, "views" has the second largest, etc.
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.
